# NEURAL-NETWORKS-IN-FORECASTING-CHAOS-THEORY-IN-ECONOMICS
Neural network is presumed to be the inevitable outcome of the swift development of artificial intelligence. 
Based on the Mackey-Glass equations system a presentation of real phase portraits and phase spaces is considered to be useful in order to extract valuable results, 
while qualitative and quantitative analysis is made for a time series of the system with the aim of studying the Mackey-Glass system in-depth. 
Neural networks provide intuitive but effective approaches to chaotic forecasting, while the forecasting efficiency is a lot higher. 
Moreover, the parameters of the proposed approach are optimized, 
and the relatively optimized parameters are obtained after a large number of data experiments (number of inputs -hidden layer, number of neurons).
